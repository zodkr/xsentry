Composer Stub for Rhymix Third-Party Programs
=============================================

Start your module with the following `composer.json` and add any other library you need.
Libraries included with Rhymix Core will be skipped
so that you can avoid duplicates and version conflicts.

```
{
  "config": {
    "optimize-autoloader": true,
    "prepend-autoloader": false
  },
  "require": {
    "rhymix/composer-stub": "dev-master"
  }
}
```
